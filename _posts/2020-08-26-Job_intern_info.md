# Introduction

This blog contains prospective job / Internship / Collaboration opportunities in different ML and AI research group. I will most summarize their necessary skill required by the company and the name of their corresponding groups. In some cases I will explore and share the groups work to get more into it. Well, lets start. They are mostly selected and chose from the linkedin, glassdoor advertisement and job openings.

**Disclaimer:** I will only note the parts interesting to me from a particular research group. Definitely there are more opportunities in the names I will put in my radar.
