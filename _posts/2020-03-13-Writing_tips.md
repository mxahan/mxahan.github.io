# Broad to Focus
I waited for ten full minutes to write but not a single words comes in to the page. It's not because of the fact that my mind is empty but the opposite. My mind is full of thougts each leading to different direction in multi dimensional setting. These facts contribute the most to make our writing uninteresting for both readers and writers. Our mind is fast but not eye and brain. Eye and mind can focus on very specific things while reading. Writers can't continue because too many direction and reader can't follow.  In both way writing becomes ineffective.

TL:DR: Too much thougts in mind doesn't help in writing.  

There lies great hardship, little bit of luck and hard works to put those thoughts into meaningful words. The *meaningful words*  terms can be put to questionary arrows like what is meaningful, to whom its meaningful, what the writer meants, for whom the writing means, why, what, how it means? One writing can't explicitly answar all the questions. Rather they focus on some parts. The more we think about the more it becomes vague and complex. The more we want to cram in our writings it takes more effort to follow alone and cover every of the answars.**But is it?** Short answer is Yes. This is where I find a great similarity between *research* and *writings*. To write effectively we must explicitely or implicitely state what and how much boundaries  are covered via this writings. Like a particular research project a writing takes care of a minor length of a grand line towards one of the infinite direction. But similar to a particular research project, writing describes us about the writer and serve a piece of puzzle towards grand scheme.

**TL:DR:** I will be talking about academic and research writing via eye of me as a researchers.

Writing full of wondering thoughts are not easy for the followers. Here come the most important piece of the information for the writer. Why someone wants to write? **Well it depends**. In this blog, I want to go over my experience of the first grand writings. I want to know how I am developing and evolving my thoughts throughout the my careers. I will elaborate what I think of that will help me next time as a proposal writer.

#### Quantity over Quality and vice-versa
I regard different opinions with utmost respect. I believe about the number of work more than quality of the works. I understand the importance of the quality too. But I prioritize the quantity with keen focus of quality. I think the power is the editing. I can't put a perfect paragraph and can't wait till I put a perfect paragraph. I know, in my whole life I will never find a perfect things. Tell me one thing that is perfect I will argue. Please don't put religious stuff down here. I am thankful to God for every single things.

Saying that what I want to point out that, don't wait for the perfect writings. Write, write, write even if is a garbage. Work, work, Work even if its not perfect. One day you will look back and will realize you have done some good or may be better works. Nobody can put perfect theory of works. You don't trust me! Well you might trust this guy, he was a genius. [Richard Feynman of on research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KmimDq4cSU)

Now you have contents. Work to improve it. Take some time to stop going for quantity and focus on quality. And after that tiny time off. Repeat - Quantity first with keeping mind to quality.

#### Problem First!

#### Results first!

#### Describe the experiments with assumption and motivation.

### Academic Writing: From the MOOC edx writing course.

[course link](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:TUMx+AWMEx+3T2020/course/)

- The 2.5 writing method. Write a mess and clean it. This would help to get over the cold start problem and writers block (solution: 0.5 step, focus free writing to simulate the flow). practice the style and master it for yourselves.
  - Write 10 minutes to simulate the flow states. Write everything down and shrink it later. Think with the fingers. Write every angle down, every thing down (the 0.5 step). Now the actual process begins. Make outline and reiterate.
  - logical flow of ideas (after 0.5), still think about ideas. beginning of the clean up process! look into the text and highlight important phase or point in what we wrote. Now make coherent sentences out of those highlighters. The ideas are in logical orders now (Draft 1) Most interesting parts
  - Polish the writing (Draft 2). Now the fine-tuning. Don't be afraid to add new sentences later on at any mentioned stages if you need it.

  Interesting points: Outlining writing should be between the 0.5 and 1 step.

- cohesion and Paragraph
  - 101: Present familiar(?) before new information (need meticulous care to perform)
    - Familiar!! Subjects that are themes of the text
    - Information from previous sentences
    - Connected phase (beware not to put many! may fake cohesion! not to overuse)
    - universal subjects (we, current research) - familiar
  - paragraph
    - Topic sentence (moderate; not to broad or narrow)
    - Provide clear milestone (sense from the topic sentences)
    - Main idea first / hypothesis - now let me prove it!!
    - evidence and details to prove the topic sentence
    - Paragraph transition - connect it with previous topic sentence -
    - Paragraph to paragraph cohesion.


- Avoid Nominalization (verbs to noun/adjective)
  - Aviod 'tion' as much as we can (modify them to verbs)
    - Both noun and adjective !!
  - When okay (3 scenario)
    - Refer to previous sentences
    - instead of the face!!
    - unnatural wordiness

- Eliminating redundancy (VVI)
  - repetitive wording  (use clause or merge adjectives)
  - Redundant pairs
  - Prepositional phrases (look for reduce the preposition - should be easy but careful) - vital parts - use them in the best possible way
  - Redundant modifier and determiners

- Active voice writings
  - passive creates confusions and add extra words.
  - permitted when agents is not important. or to keep cohesion.

- Avoid sprawling sentences -cause stylistic problem
  - Sprawling: fit too many ideas altogether.
  - Read the sentence in one breathe! read the writing out loud (no tripping)
  - should go to subject immediately/quickly (Keep introductory phase concise)
  - try to Go with concrete subject  
  - stop interruption between subject-verb-object. (keep them as close as possible)
  - not too many relative clauses (eliminate redundancy)

- Credibility -
  - Register - level of formality (word choice)
    - not conversational (avoid you)
    - Use Precise word and neutral tone
    - Avoid but/and/so at beginning
    - Avoid rhetoric question.
    - Avoid informal words!
  - Hedging - Tone
    - Modal verbs: May/can
    - Seems to: appear,
    - Possibly: probable, if, occasionally
  - Avoid Plagiarism: Must  
    - Cite and Refer Must
    - Distinguish what is your and others
    - Paraphrasing is important.
      - careful synonyms
      - changing sentence structure.

-Punctuation
  - Comma - no hard fast rule !!
    - not to use comma to separate independent clauses (comma splice error)
    - use comma to clear introductory element
    - No comma after coordinating conjunction, but use before them.
    - Comma to emphasis.
    - No comma that separates subject-verb-object, but may use pair comma. (great solution)
    - no comma for defining Relative clauses (may use comma for non-defining comma.)
    - The oxford comma! (comma before and)
  - Others ;:.''
    - : for list (independent clause and list) / mostly sub-clauses
    - ; Separates independent cluases.  
    - Non-essential information () or double comma.
    - ! not recommendation.

- Why we write?
  - Keep the big picture in mind: Motivation, and goal. -why is it interesting, how did you get there, what does the work brings?
  - Choose Genre and think audience - What are you writing.
  - Organize and structure of the paper - Create outline. (change logically if requires.)

*Personal Summary*: Writing concerns about expressing the thoughts. It's the writers responsibly to clearly write the thoughts for readers. Thoughts runs around neuron to neuron inside head. To express it inside the pen-paper, a good guidelines are necessary. Good structure sews the thread of thoughts like an expert. The structure should reflect the big picture. It should be stand-alone to express and support the thoughts' materialization over paper in a black-box manner. However, in practice, the ideas/thoughts will govern the shape structure to fully fit itself within the body of those created structure. A good structure requires some good amount of plannings and thoughts itself.

The structure serves two special goals. Firstly, forms a basis of what to write to express. A bad structure fails to provides spaces for thoughts to take shape in writing. If writers has still information to structure beyond the current framework the structure requires to be reformulated. So, it becomes an iterative process. This can be expressed by a simple algorithm. **(i) Formulate a structure based on the thoughts/goal/big picture (ii)Does that structure holds the necessary spaces for thoughts to take shape? If yes No worries. If No, please reconstruct the structure**. Secondly, it provides a platform for the writers to focus on what to put in a particular place. I believes, the structuring accelerates the writing. This can be again traced back to first goal. While filling if the writer really heat bottom of spaces to put his thoughts, he requires to reformulate the structure.

The structure is not always the big heading! It may also provide cohesion for each paragraph and sentences. We can call the big structure as Macro basis and the paragraph structure as micro basis. Macro Basis are utmost important for independent academic writing like paper, grant, proposal. Macro basis concerns with the goal and purpose of the writing. It serves the 101 of writing: Expressing thoughts in the best way. The writer must find the best possible macro structure for his writings in iterative fashion. On the contrary, In case of already structured setting, the macro basis are already formulated for the writer, which can be a good structure or bad structure. Writers should obey this constraint. I feel the writers should start with the MACRO basis before even starts to write, by considering the big picture and goals. As writer focuses on Macro-basis time to time, he always aims the big picture and writing goals.

In all scenarios (macro basis given or formulated), micro basis structure plays a vital role. The writer's choice of best micro basis creates the best writing conditioned on the provided information. The micro basis treads the information already exists. This is where the 2.5 writing comes to play. As soon as we have macro basis we use our 0.5 draft to put the information altogether. Micro basis structure takes those and edit them in a comprehensible manner, the 2 writing. **Macro basis threads key information from 0.5 draft to support and clarify each of the macro basis. Micro basis aims to uphold and help one specific macro basis itself towards overall goal, eventually filling the purpose of expressing thoughts clearly**. In case of left over information from the 0.5 draft, the writers need to rethink the micro structure to address those missed points.

Personal Motto: **Each Written Word Matters Towards Going Forward. So Write Wisely only in the final Drafts.**
