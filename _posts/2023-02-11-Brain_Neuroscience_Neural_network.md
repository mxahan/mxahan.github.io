   - Conscious experiences form a relatively diverse class of psychological phenomena which suggests that consciousness occupies a variety of different functional roles across different task domains, individuals, and species (*functional pluralism*)
     -  consciousness contributes a cluster of functions to visual processing; facilitating
     - (i) increased capacities for semantically processing informationally complex visual stimuli, 
     - (ii) increased spatiotemporal precision 
     - (iii) increased capacities for representational integration over large spatiotemporal intervals
   - discuss semantic and spatiotemporal processing as specific points of comparison between the functional capabilities of the visual system in the presence and absence of conscious awareness.
   - can be used to guide future research in the philosophy and science of consciousness, some of which are not captured by popular theoretical frameworks like global workspace theory and information integration theory.
