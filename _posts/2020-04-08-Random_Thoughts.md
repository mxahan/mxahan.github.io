# How to be a good researcher!
First and foremost, Be honest, Be absolutely honest. Give credit. We never achieve anything alone, we grow together as a researcher. Read! Understand! Site! and repeat till death. It's a Profession, and definitely with fun.  

The second point, Never doubt yourselves. Leaves the negativity away. Don't listen to the negative thoughts or negative people. Stay close to the people who love or stay alone and continue to perform hard work, reading, research.
#### Know where you want to work

#### Keep eye wide open (Don't be over-focused)

#### Know the Big researchers in your field

#### Know you broad domain

##### Improve and solidify Theoretical Knowledge

##### Know terminology

#### Know the state-of-the-arts of your field
Read and study recent papers publication to stay up-to-date. This is different than earlier point of knowing big research. Familiarize with Big names, Research groups on the spectrum of your work/project. Track and follow their works from earlier time to current time. Get ideas about their current and recent projects, problem focuses, methodologies. Mind the conflict of interest.

#### Find the Research Gap and formulate question.


#### Approach based on the problems (!not targeting particular application)
Keep focus on the problem. Even if you don't find solution, be specific to problem. Don't avoid the question because the solution is out of scope for now.

#### Innovative, New, trending and Novel Ideas (Care to know state of art)
Always look for ideas. Borrow ideas from different fields.

#### Be Efficient and Organized (Wherever possible)
Keep track of what you need/want to know both in broad and project focus senses. Stay organized in keeping, collecting and implementing ideas. Efficient in coding. I like to put the names down. Most of the time I never revisit but I know I have access to them, which is assuring. Keep your File manager, publication manager (Zotero, Mendeley) as organized as possible. Look back at them and reorganize. It will never be perfect and we can always refine and make it better. Stay organized in google (slides, docs, collabs, drive), codes, data, github, computer folders whatever you have. Spend some time to rethink your own file managing systems time to time. I am sometimes hesitant to remove somethings sometimes which is not always good. If somethings are forgotten may be they are not currently important. Trust yourselves to re-collect them if you ever need them. It gives me confidence in my myself rather than depending too much on the file managers and computer hard drives.

Make absolute sure to look back and edit, organize and rethink things sometimes.

#### Look for the funding opportunities and what are funded for

#### Look for job opportunities and what skills are required

#### Be Proactive
Don't wait for things to happens automatically. This is research. You have to do your own work. It's not wise to sit and follow order and wait hoping to complete the Ph.D. in 5 years. It may works for some Ph. D. but not for research. We have to be proactive and try our own things. I do understand the value of collaborations. We can be very proactive in collaborations. Try your own things it will work eventually in the right way after you figure the way by proactive attempting.

#### Don't Be ignorant about your limitation
Every Research has some limitation in its own ways. It not the work but the idea should be limitless. So, keep and identify your problems and limitation of your works. Don't be hesitant to write and put forth the limitations of your research before someone else put finger at it. Prepare and think of appropriate answer to the limitation. We can think our ways around the limitations and these limitations will energize our works to limitless. But we must make sure we acknowledge all the issues, problems and limitations of our current researches.

#### Take some times off
Think, study and take sometimes out off your focus once in a while (may be days, week or at least once in a month). Balance this with your focus project or research works. Utilize this time either to look back or look beyond your researches. In my case I take some times off to write blogs. This eventually increases my writing skills and helps my research. I love playing badminton and table tennis. Streaming off the body takes my mind off and aid me with a clearer mind for the next time to focus on the long term goals.

One Keynote to remember that this taking time off should still focus on research in a passive ways. Be sure to balance the time and keep main focus and labor on the original researches and projects.

#### Know where you want to reach

#### Know and master your logistics

#### Focus on the problems, not your current skills

## Reading a Scientific Paper

Look at the authors name, groups, affiliations, Previous works, PIs. Look at the conference/journal or publication platform for particular paper. Then start reading. My thoughts on approaching the paper to [critical review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZtCiIMHxB-XXlwHbkXsm_uYBx7nPuW41/view?usp=sharing). Special thanks to [Professor Asif Salekin](https://asalekin.github.io/) for sharing his initial slides.

## Be extreme curious about alternatives with drawbacks

It's more important to guess while taking state-of-the-art knowledge. Don't randomly put problems and wrong doing in front. Be aware of the probable alternatives ways to do that thing and then come for curiosity to know the alternatives experiments and outcomes. Get ideas how you can improve it? Where and what to improve?

## Definitely Argue till one of you gets corrected

If something is fundamentally wrong to you definitely dive deep and argue till either your thoughts or the counter thoughts have a clear edges.

# Life and Balance

Extreme of anything is very bad. Why we work hard? To get a better life. If we don't enjoy it what's the point? Make sure you have a balance.
