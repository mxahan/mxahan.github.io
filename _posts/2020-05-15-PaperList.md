# Introduction

This blog contains paperlist I want and plan to go through. For detail paper read please refer to the Paper summary section. Here we will store lots of papers title or maybe little summary considering I will be storing only interested papers. We can't worry about everything and nothing. We must stay focused and broad at the same time. Very true! By the way, I will appreciate any suggestion on the paperlist. I know the Feynman's concept of knowing name means nothing, it's just the entrance to the grand scheme of the world.
