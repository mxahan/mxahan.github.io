     - PAWS (Predicting view assignments with support samples)

     - Minimize a consistency loss!! different view to get same pseudo labels

     - RQ: can we leverage the labeled data throughout training while also building on advances in self-supervised learning?

     - How the heck the distance between view representation and labeled representation is used to provide weights over class labels (why is makes sense, and what benefits it offers??)

     - Assumption: Labeled data and unlabeled data, some common classes in unlabeled data and rest is from novel classes (GCD setting)
     - Instead of training an OOD detector and SSL separately, TP propose a multitask curriculum learning framework
       - OOD detection:  estimate the probability of the sample belonging to OOD
       - a joint optimization framework, which updates the network parameters and the OOD score alternately
       - to improve performance on the classification (ID) data, TP  select ID samples in unlabeled data having small OOD scores, and retrain training the deep neural networks to classify ID samples in a semi-supervised manner.
     - **Key assumption:**  that a network trained with a high learning rate is less likely to overfit to noisy labels
       - train OOD detection and hope that the noisy samples will be filtered automatically.
     - As simple as heck: Select only top confidence sample from the unlabeled data for retraining the labeled classifier. (curriculum)
       - Algorithm 1 and 2

     -  unlabeled data contains some classes not seen in the labeled data.
       - TP: proposes a simple and effective safe deep SSL method to alleviate the harm caused by it
     - Kinda NCD formulation
     - Proposes instance to weight weighting funciton!! multiplied with consistency regularization.  
       - What and how and why, is that scalable?? how to do it for image?
       - Vague one, safely ignore the paper!
     - Safe (!)
     - Bi-level optimization problem
       - supervised and consistency loss regularization

     - Soft pseudo-label (with correct setting can outperform consistency regularization: Noise Accumulation!)
       - TP: Tries to eliminate the CB without Consistency regularization
         - Drop-out and data augmentation can eliminate CB
       - Naive pseudo-label overfits to incorrect one due to confirmation bias (how to measure CB). 
       - Mixup and setting a minimum number of labeled samples per mini-batch are effective regularization techniques reduces confirmation bias
       - They utilize external KL matching. 
       - label smoothing alleviate the overconfidence problem. 
       - Mixup data augmentation alone is insufficient to deal with CB when few labeled examples are provided
     - Sum of three losses: Entropy loss (enforce single decision), distribution (removing collapse) matching and mixup (counter CB) loss 
       - Relative weight between them matters

     - advocate a two-step approach where feature learning and clustering are decoupled
       - SSL and SSL prior for learnable clustering.
       - remove the ability for cluster learning to depend on low-level features (current end-to-end learning approaches.)

     - Representation **learning  leads to imbalanced clusters and there is no guarantee that the learned clusters aligns with the semantic classes**

         - end-to-end learning pipelines combine feature learning with clustering.
           - leverage the architecture of CNNs as a prior to cluster images (DEC)
           - learn a clustering function by maximizing the mutual information between an image and its augmentations
             - sensitive to initialization or prone to degenerate solutions
             - since the cluster learning depends on the network initialization, they are likely to latch onto low-level features

         - [TP]: SCAN (Semantic Clustering by Adopting Nearest neighbors) - 2-steps
           - *leaverage advantage of both representation learning and end-end learning*
           - encourage invariance w.r.t. the nearest neighbors, and not solely w.r.t. augmentations

      - Methods summary: 1. Representation learning for semantic clustering,
        - Contrastive learning (loss function 2) with entropy regularizer.
          - Fine-tuning through self-labeling

   - FixMatch: a significant simplification of existing SSL methods
     - Generates pseudo-labels using the modelâ€™s predictions on weakly augmented unlabeled images
       - Retained if confidence is high.

   - semi supervised learning (should cover the labeled and unlabeled at the beginning)

     - teacher network - to generate - pseudo labels [extension of pseudo label work]
       - TP: Contrary to the Pseudo label work: *The teacher network is not fixed* and constantly adapting [claim: teacher learn better pseudo labels]
       - Connected to Pseudo Labels/self-training (semi-supervised)

     - Issues with the confirmation bias of pseudo label? does TP solve this??
       - correct the confirmation bias using a systematic mechanism!!! (how pseudo-label affect the student network) [figure 1]
       - Parallel training [student's learning feedback goes to teacher]!! (dynamic target!)

     - assumption: Pseudo label of teacher can be adjusted
       - However, extremely complication optimization as it requires to unroll everything!
     - Sampling hard pseudo labels (modified version of REINFORCE algorithm!)

8. Li, Junnan, Richard Socher, and Steven CH Hoi. "Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.07394 (2020).

   - TP:  divide the training data into a labeled set with clean samples and an unlabeled set with noisy samples (co-training two networks), and trains the model on both data (?). Improved MixMatch

   - TP: Two diverged network (avoid confirmation bias of self-training) use each others data! GMM to find labeled and unlabeled (too much noisy) data.  Ensemble for the unlabeled.

   - Related strategy: MixUp (noisy sample contribute less to loss!), co-teaching?  Loss correction approach? Semi-supervised learning, MixMatch (unifies SSL and LNL [consistency regularization, entropy minimization, and MixUp])

   - Application: Data with noisy label (social media image with tag!) may result poor generalization (as may overfit)!

   - Hypothesis: DNNs tend to learn simple patterns first before fitting label noise Therefore, many methods treat samples with small loss as clean ones (discards the sample labels that are highly likely to be noisy! and leverages them as unlabeled data)

   - Algorithm is nice to work with

     - Interesting way to improve the Classifier

     - (labeled data) -> Build classifier (T) -> (predict unlabeled data) -> Train Student using both labeled + model predicted unlabeled data. Repeat.. [algo 1]

     - Introduce noise for both T and S.
       - Data noise, model noise (dropout)

     - adopts a binary pairwise classification framework for image clustering [DAC]
         - learned label features tend to be one-hot vectors (constraint into DAC)
             - single-stage named Adaptive Learning algorithm to  streamline the learning procedure for image clustering
               - dynamically learn the threshold for pairwise label selection [section 3.3]
     - *summary:* chose two adaptive th for pairwise labels. iterative fix the network and th to reduce number of unlabeled images.  
       - *metrics:* Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and clustering Accuracy (ACC).

     - trained to simultaneously minimize the sum of sup and unsup cost functions by backpropagation, avoiding the need for layer-wise pre-training
       - builds on top of the Ladder network [bit out of my interest for now]

     - Semi-supervised learning by minimum entropy regularization!
       - result compared with mixture models ! (entropy methods are better)
       - Connected to cluster assumption and manifold learning

     - Motivation behind supervised training for unlabeled data
       - Exhaustive generative search
         - More parameters to be estimation that leads to more uncertainty

     - Improves Temporal Ensemble by average model weights (usual practice now!) instead of label prediction (WOW!)
          - Temporal and Pi model suffers from confirmation bias (requires better target) as self-teacher!

     - Two ways to improve: chose careful perturbation or chose careful teacher model

     - Result: Mean teacher is better! faster converge and higher accuracy

     - Importance of good architecture (TP: Residual networks):

     - TP: how to form better teacher model from students.
          - TP: Large batch, large dataset, on-line learning.

     - A form of consistency regularization.
          - Self-ensemble (Exponential moving average), consensus prediction of unknown labels!!
            - Ensemble Utilization of outputs of different network-in-training (same network: different epochs, different regularization!!, and input augmentations) to predict unlabeled data.
            - The predicted unlabeled data can be used to train another network
            - One point to put a distinction between semi-supervised learning and representation learning-fine tuning. In Semi-sup the methods uses the label from the beginning.
             - Importance on the Data Augmentation and Regularization.

          - TP: Two self-ensemble methods: pi-model and temporal ensemble (Figure 1) based on consistency losses.
          - Pi Model: Forces the embedding to be together (Contrastive parts is in the softmax portion; prevents collapse)
               - Pi vs Temporal model:
                 - (Benefit of temporal) Temporal model is faster.In case of temporal, training target is less noisy.
                 - (Downside of temporal) Store auxiliary data! Memory mapped file.
