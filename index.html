	<h1>Hi there, I'm Zahid Hasan!</h1>
	<p> I seek to Ask the right question also Take nothing for granted. I also believe we all are replaceable (Future)
		but each can contribute in a irreplaceable way (Past).
		<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
	<p>  I also write about what I read (others research works). Writing helps me to understand thoughtly. I also write
		about my own research. It helps me to understand better what I am doing. I try to put references whatever I
		write. But sometimes Its not convient to get the appropriate citing as it halts learning for me. I plan to learn
		expand my knowledge through these blogs. So, Please let me know if I go overboard sometimes without citing, as
		this is not academic writing. As Richard Feynmay suggessted what we can't create we don't understand.</p>
